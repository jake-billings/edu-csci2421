*  Description of the program
*******************************************************

 Task: Implement an event-based simulation of a bank line as described in the homework problem
    customer arrivals are represented by CustomerEvent where the type is "ARRIVAL"
    these arrivals imply departures
    departures can only occur after a customer has waited in line then processed a transaction
     at the head of the line

 Outline
 =======
  - describe(), assertInt() - Simple Test Suite Functions
  - test() Unit Testing
  - main(), which includes a call to test() and demo


*******************************************************
*  Source files
*******************************************************

Name:  main.cpp
   main.cpp contains a simple set of function for unit testing, unit
   tests, and a demo.

   test() contains unit tests

   main() calls test() then runs a demo of the program

Name:  CustomerEvent.cpp
   Implementation file for CustomerEvent class
   CustomerEvent class represents either a "departure"
    or "arrival"

Name:  CustomerEvent.h
   Declaration file for CustomerEvent class
   CustomerEvent class represents either a "departure"
    or "arrival"

Name:  CustomerEventType.h
   Declaration file for CustomerEventType enum
   CustomerEventType is an enum that represents a state of
    either: DEPARTURE or ARRIVAL

Name:  Simulation.cpp
   Implementation file for Simulation funciton
   simulate() accepts a priority_queue of ARRIVAL
   events, simulates the bank line, and returns
   a SimulationResult object containing output
   and statistics

Name:  Simulation.h
   Declartion file for Simulation funciton
   simulate() accepts a priority_queue of ARRIVAL
   events, simulates the bank line, and returns
   a SimulationResult object containing output
   and statistics

Name:  SimulationResult.cpp
   Implementation file for SimulationResult class
   the simulation result contains all of the statistics
   and output necessary to display or to unit test
   the function simulate()

Name:  SimulationResult.h
   Declaration file for SimulationResult class
   the simulation result contains all of the statistics
   and output necessary to display or to unit test
   the function simulate()

Name:  input.txt
   Contains the string input from the homework problem
   each row represents an ARRIVAL event with start time
   and duration

Name:  simulation_output.txt
   Contains the string output from the book's problem.
   This was not generated by the program. It is what
   the program "should" output. It is used for unit
   testing.


*******************************************************
*  Status of program
*******************************************************

   The program runs successfully.  
   
   The program was developed and tested on CLion on OSX.  It was
   compiled, run, and tested on csegrid.ucdenver.pvt.
