# edu-csci2421
This repository contains the work I completed for the course CSCI2421 Data Structures and Program Design at the University of Colorado Denver.

## Unit Testing
I don't use a testing framework for these assignments. However, I do automate testing using a few functions in each `main.cpp` file.

See the functions: `assertString`, `assertInt`, and `describe` in each project.

## Documentation
Each project contains a `readme.txt` file. These have been completed in a format required for by the class at UCD. Each readme documents the purpose of each project, the requirements, and the implementation details.

## Work
