*  Description of the program
*******************************************************


 Task: I intpereted the task for this homework as follows:
  1. Load vehicles from vehicle input.txt
  2. Ask a user for a target year
  3. Perform a recursive binary search for a car that matches that year
  4. Perform an iterative binary search for a car that matches that year

 My program performs automated testing on load, sort, and search
 functions then demos the functionality via command-line
 ineraction.

 Outline
 =======
  - describe(), assertInt() - Simple Test Suite Functions
  - test() Unit Testing
  - main(), which includes a call to test() and demo


*******************************************************

Name:  main.cpp
   main.cpp contains a simple set of function for unit testing, unit
   tests, and a demo.

   test() contains unit tests

   main() calls test() then runs a demo of the program

Name:  functions.h
   contains function definitions for searching and sorting
   functions

   see file for function docs

Name:  functions.cpp
   contains function implementations for searching and sorting
   functions

   see file for function docs

Name:  Vehicle.h
   contains class definition for the Vehicle class

   see file for function and class docs

Name:  Vehicle.h
   contains class implementation for the Vehicle class
