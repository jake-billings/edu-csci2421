*  Description of the program
*******************************************************

 Task: I interpreted the task for this homework as follows:
   1. Download MyVector.h
   2. Implement MyVector in MyVector.cpp

 My program performs automated testing on load, sort, and search
 functions then demos the functionality via command-line
 ineraction.

 Outline
 =======
  - describe(), assertInt() - Simple Test Suite Functions
  - test() Unit Testing
  - main(), which includes a call to test() and demo


*******************************************************
*  Source files
*******************************************************

Name:  main.cpp
   main.cpp contains a simple set of function for unit testing, unit
   tests, and a demo.

   test() contains unit tests

   main() calls test() then runs a demo of the program

Name:  MyVector.h
   contains class definition for the MyVector class
   this was provided by the assignment, and I have not edited it

Name:  MyVector.h
   contains class implementation for the MyVector class
   I implemented this solution.
   see file for function docs

   
*******************************************************
*  Status of program
*******************************************************

   The program runs successfully.  
   
   The program was developed and tested on CLion on OSX.  It was
   compiled, run, and tested on csegrid.ucdenver.pvt.
