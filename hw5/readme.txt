This implementation is locked by project requirements
to use a pre-written header file. This header file
contains a full Node object as the head instead of
just a head pointer. It also doesn't use generic typing.
A better LinkedList example is available at this link:

*******************************************************
*  Description of the program
*******************************************************

 Task:
  1. Implement LinkedList in a cpp file based on LinkList.h
  2. Verify the functionality of LinkedList in main.cpp
  3. Analyze the asyptotic complexity of the following functions:
    a. insertAtFront()
    b. insertAtBack()

 Outline
 =======
  - describe(), assertInt() - Simple Test Suite Functions
  - test() Unit Testing
  - main(), which includes a call to test() and demo


*******************************************************
*  Source files
*******************************************************

Name:  main.cpp
   main.cpp contains a simple set of function for unit testing, unit
   tests, and a demo.

   test() contains unit tests

   main() calls test() then runs a demo of the program

Name:  LinkedList.h
   contains class definition for the LinkedList class
   this was provided by the assignment, and I have not edited it

Name:  LinkedList.cpp
   contains class implementation for the LinkedList class
   I implemented this solution.
   see file for function docs

   
*******************************************************
*  Status of program
*******************************************************

   The program runs successfully.  
   
   The program was developed and tested on CLion on OSX.  It was
   compiled, run, and tested on csegrid.ucdenver.pvt.
